        **SUMMARY**: We are going to implement and optimize a solver for the vehicle routing problem using OpenMPI with distributed task queues and work stealing to manage load balancing. We will measure cost using large datasets of real-world Uber data, and minimize the round-trip cost of a vehicle fleet that covers every node. We will achieve this by forming all partitions of the vertices of the Uber data, and running a sequential traveling salesman algorithm on each parallel processor.

        **BACKGROUND**: Given a large map with various nodes and weights on the edges, the vehicle routing problem must guarantee that each node is visited by at least one vehicle within the vehicle fleet. Our approach to this project would be to first optimize a single instance of the traveling salesman problem, requiring 1 vehicle to visit every single node while minimizing the cost. Then we would parallelize the problem by partitioning the vertices of the map into subsets and assigning each vehicle to travel through a unique subset.
          One way that this application can benefit from parallelism, especially on a large computing cluster, is that a work efficient sequential solution to the traveling salesman problem can be employed on every compute node. Then this allows for a brute force approach to be utilized due to the computing power, guaranteeing the optimal solution to the problem. The parallelism can also be useful when partitioning the map by vehicle, as there is a lot of processing involved in creating all of the different vehicle-map assignment possibilities.

        **THE CHALLENGE**: The largest challenge that we are going to face is achieving workload balance among processing nodes. Not only do we have to account for preprocessing the points into all partitions in parallel, but we also have to determine the proper distribution of processing the points, and how to ensure that work stealing will be successful. Finding the optimal workload balance will be tricky with a high processor count and large dataset. For example, with a work stealing implementation, this would require a large amount of communication between processors to ensure a fine granularity of dynamic assignment, but too much communication will overshadow computation. If we then want to reduce communication and increase locality, we might try to reuse data so that in an OpenMPI framework less particles need to be communicated. 
          Another factor that we will need to consider is that there is a data dependency between generating the tasks for each processor, and if not executed carefully could result in detrimental bottlenecks. One thought we had, since there is a large amount of processing to be done to create tasks for processors, is that we could employ some form of pipelining to reduce latency. A constraint that we will need to keep in mind is the large size of the dataset compared to the individual node’s memory size.

        RESOURCES: For our project, we would need to access the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Cluster (PSC). For our approach to the vehicle routing problem, we will begin by referencing the following papers, although a single instance of the traveling salesman problem is not our focus as we will focus on parallelizing the Vehicle Routing Problem. We will reference the algorithms from these papers to implement our own solution.

        **GOALS AND DELIVERABLES**
        PLAN TO ACHIEVE:
        Implement a parallelized version of the Vehicle Routing Problem in C++ using OpenMPI. 
        Process and utilize large Uber datasets to create a graph of the United States for the program to use.
        Improve load balancing by implementing distributed task queues and work stealing between processors.
        Create a visual graph of the inputs and outputs of the program in python showing the results of the program and the changes in the solution over time as it works.
        For the poster session, create speedup graphs after each optimization and also run the aforementioned python graphing as a live demo
        
        HOPE TO ACHIEVE:
        Have 0.7x linear speedup over a single core parallel version, because we think this is reasonably difficult given the communication to computation ratio.
        Utilize real-time Uber data using the Uber APIs
        Explore a parallel implementation of the traveling merchant problem (Only possible if we are doing VERY well)
        Implement the Vehicle Routing Problem using OpenMP and compare the performance between the two implementations.

        **PLATFORM CHOICE**: We chose to utilize the PSC because our parallel implementation would benefit from a large amount of CPUs. Our program does not seem to fit with the GPU architecture due to low amount of instruction level parallelism and variance in workload. We’ll be using C++ for the parallel implementation due to familiarity, speed of execution, and compatibility with Open MPI. We would also be using some python for data manipulation and displaying results.
